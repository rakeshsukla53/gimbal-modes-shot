# Color Grading

Three basic things that define color is:

    HUE - Color
    Saturation - Intensity of Hue
    Luma - Brightness of Hue

So the basic workflow to correcting a video is:

- Correct Exposure
- Fix White Balance
- Adjust Saturation

# Correct Exposure

This is fixed by going to Color Wheels.

`shadow` - it controls the darkest part of the image. The darkest part should sit right above `0`

`highlights` - it controls the brightest part of the image. The brightest party should sit right below `100`

`midtones` - it controls everything else in between. Use it to fix the image tones

`master` - it controls everything

# Fix White Balance

# Color Curves

The top point is for changing the `highlights` and the bottom point
is for changing the `shadows`
