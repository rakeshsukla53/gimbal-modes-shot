# Color Grading

Three basic things that define color is:

    HUE - Color
    Saturation - Intensity of Hue
    Luma - Brightness of Hue

So the basic workflow to correcting a video is:

- Correct Exposure
- Fix White Balance
- Adjust Saturation

This is fixed by going to Color Wheels.

shadow - it controls the darkest part of the image
highlights - it controls the brightest part of the image
midtones - it controls the centre of the image
master - it controls everything
