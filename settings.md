# For slow motion

Glad you liked the video, thanks ! This is 4k 60fps in Wide view
slowed down to 24fps. I activated protune and left everything on auto,
low sharpness (medium is also great but avoid high as this is for
stills), WB 5500. I used a circular polarizer, added a tiny bit of
green in post, and what makes the biggest difference :
I used a special technique in Adobe After Effects to get rid of
the barrel distortion. For stabilisation, I have used the Karma Grip
and added a little extra stabilisation in post using the
warp stabiliser. Hope this helps :)
