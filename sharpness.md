# Sharpness

    1. Medium sharpness is best. Low is way too soft and High can have over-sharpening.
    2. Stabilization does not impact sharpness (as expected)
    3. Hero 7 may be a small amount sharper than the Hero 6.
    4. Frame rate (60p vs 30p) does not impact sharpness
    5. 2.7K has very minor loss of detail compared to 4K! I am surprised by how little the difference is.
    6. Color profile (Flat vs GoPro) does not impact sharpness
